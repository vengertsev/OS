To compute the rotational delay for 18, first figure out how long the disk
would take to rotate from the end of the access to sector 10 to the beginning
of the access to sector 18, assuming a zero-cost seek. As you can see from the
simulator, sector 10 on the outer track is lined up with sector 22 on the middle
track, and there are 7 sectors separating 22 from 18 (23, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
and 17, as the disk spins counter-clockwise). Rotating through 7 sectors takes
210 time units (30 per sector). However, the first part of this rotation is
actually spent seeking to the middle track, for 40 time units. Thus, the
actual rotational delay for accessing sector 18 is 210 minus 40, or 170 time
units. Run the simulator to see this for yourself; note that you can run
without graphics and with the "-c" flag to just see the results without
seeing the graphics.
